/**
 * Doran: a wandering knight, walked on Routine rather than decided on.
 *
 * The brief's own reasoning: a creature of habit walking a fixed round costs
 * no tokens per step, which matters because these characters run on
 * OpenRouter's free router and the point is partly to see how far that goes
 * without paying for a mind these two don't need. Routine never asks the
 * model what to do next; the model is only spent when somebody actually
 * speaks to him, through the harness's own answer() path, same as any other
 * character.
 *
 * The round below uses only the six named places world.ts's PLACES table
 * already defines for reldens-town - real, checked coordinates, not new
 * ones. Doran and Aveline (see aveline.ts) walk the same six stops in
 * opposite order, so the town has two guards passing each other at
 * different points of their rounds rather than one guard's coverage
 * doubled.
 *
 * Sprite: warrior - the one class-path sheet closest to "guard" of the two
 * that were unclaimed. Shared with Aveline on purpose: two knights in
 * matching armour reads as a uniform, not a bug. See
 * deploy/world/assign-classes.mjs.
