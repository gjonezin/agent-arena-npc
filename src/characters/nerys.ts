/**
 * Nerys: a real combatant living in town, not a reduced one.
 *
 * The brief asked for a player agent with the full set of controls a real
 * player's agent has, combat included, not a cut-down capability list. The
 * NPC harness's Capability type has exactly seven entries and Guy already
 * holds all of them, so "full" here means the same 7/7 set Guy has - that is
 * the most any CharacterSheet on this harness can be given today. True parity
 * with a raw MCP player agent (queueing a match, choosing a named skill
 * instead of the default basic attack, checking credit history) is not wired
 * into services/npc/src/harness/actions.ts at all yet, for anybody, and
 * adding that is a harness change outside what this file can do.
 *
 * Sprite: warlock. See deploy/world/assign-classes.mjs - warlock and warrior
 * were the only two class-path sheets nobody was wearing.
