  // This used to be the sealed door upstairs at the inn, and it broke him in a
  // way worth writing down, because the shape of the mistake will happen again.
  // The aim was fine. The done was "somebody else has admitted what is up
  // there", and there is nothing up there: the second floor's only two change
  // points are the stairs back down. A condition nobody can meet is not a hard
  // goal, it is a loop, and he ran it for days - street, inn, upstairs, inn,
  // street - while the one character built to go out and find trouble never
  // left three rooms.
  //
  // It cost more than Guy. His goal told him to get somebody to say out loud
  // that he was right about the door, so he asked everybody, for days, and that
  // is where the whole town's talk of doors and keys and the Hinge Gate came
  // from. One unreachable done condition became this world's largest rumour.

  // So: never write a done that another character has to satisfy. He is the
  // only one who can decide when this one is finished, and getting there walks
  // him through most of the world, which is what he is for.
