/**
 * What a character is allowed to remember.
 *
 * Two things have to be true at once. A character who has lived in a town for
 * years should remember the people in it, and should be allowed to be fond of
 * some of them and sick of others. And nothing they remember should ever be
 * able to change who they are.
 *
 * Those pull against each other if memory is free text, because free text can
 * say anything, including "you are cheerful now". So memory here is a schema.
 * A character can record what it has learned about *other people*, what has
 * *happened*, and what it is *going after*, and there is no field in which to
 * store a different self. The persona is the agent's instructions, a separate
 * system message that memory never writes to; this schema is why memory cannot
 * smuggle a rewrite into the fields it does control.
 *
 * Wanting something new is not becoming someone else, which is why the goal
 * lives here and is the character's to change. A person who finishes what they
 * set out to do and then wants nothing is not a person.
 *
 * Scope is per character. Nothing is shared between them: Barnaby's opinion of
 * you is his own, and he does not inherit the Wanderer's.

 * A tool call that failed, left where it fell, quietly costs a character its

 * counter handles four tool-invocation states: call, partial-call, result and
 * output-denied. A part in "output-error" - a tool that threw - falls off the
 * end of that and it throws instead. Compaction is inside a workflow step, so
 * the throw does not stop the character; it just means observation fails every
 * tick from then on, for good, and nothing ever gets folded down.
 *
 * That is a one-part poison with a whole-history blast radius. Guy had one, an
 * `explore` that failed on the tenth of August. The Wanderer had two `look`s.
 * Barnaby had none, which is exactly why Barnaby was the only one of the three
 * whose logs were clean while the other two errored on every turn.
 *
 * So they get rewritten as what they actually were: a call that completed with
 * an error for its result. That is true, it is a state the counter accepts, and
 * it keeps the record of the failure rather than pretending the call never
 * happened. Cheap to run and almost always a no-op, so it runs at build time
 * rather than waiting for somebody to notice compaction has been dead for a
 * week.
 *
 * The real fix belongs upstream, in the counter. Until it lands this is the
 * difference between having compaction and only appearing to.

 * Run the observation Mastra was configured for and never going to run.
 *
 * Found with the prompt trace and settled with a local reproduction against a
 * copy of a live character's memory: getStatus() said shouldObserve with
 * 55,000 pending tokens against a 5,000 threshold, om.observe() worked the
 * moment it was called, and production had never called it once. Mastra runs
 * threshold observation while preparing step two of a tool-loop turn, and
 * these characters' turns are a single generate() with no tool loop - there
 * is never a step two. The idle-buffering fallback at turn end only fires
 * while pending tokens are still BELOW the threshold, which they never are
 * again once observation has been missed even once. Wedged from both sides,
 * quietly, for every character at once.
 *
 * Consequence, and why this is the single most load-bearing function in the
 * memory system: with observational memory enabled, Mastra keeps every
 * unobserved message in every prompt - dropping unobserved history would lose
 * it forever, so lastMessages only bounds the observed tail. No observation
 * means the window is the whole life. The Wanderer was carrying 1,332
 * messages, about 62,000 tokens, into every single call.
 *
 * So the harness drives it, with the same public API Mastra's own docs show:
 * ask getStatus, call observe when it says to. One at a time per character -
 * an observe can take a minute on a fat backlog, ticks keep coming, and two
 * concurrent observes over one SQLite file is exactly the kind of trouble
 * this file has seen before (see restartWhenCompactionJams).
 *
 * Returns what it did, for the log line and the ledger: 'observed' when a
 * pass ran and succeeded, 'busy' when one is already running, 'settled' when
 * there was nothing to fold, 'failed' carrying the reason otherwise.

 * database open. The character exits, comes back up under restart: always,
 * and buildMemory() fixes it with the file to itself.
