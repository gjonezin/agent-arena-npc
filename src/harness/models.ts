/**
 * What a character thinks with, and what it thinks with when the money runs out.
 *
 * This world has gone quiet before because an account emptied. Every character
 * stops at once, which is the worst possible failure: not one person behaving
 * oddly, but a town where nobody moves and nothing is obviously broken. The
 * logs say the provider refused and that is all.
 *
 * So nobody names a single model any more. A character names the one it would
 * rather use, and the free router is put underneath it, and Mastra walks the
 * list until something answers. A character on a paid model that has run dry
 * carries on thinking, more cheaply and probably less well, which is a great
 * deal better than standing still.
 *
 * The free router goes last for everyone and is never removed, because it is
 * the floor. If it is also the character's first choice there is nothing to
 * fall back to and the list is one entry: falling back from free to free would
 * just double the wait before giving up.

 * which does not exist and answers 502. Checked against the live endpoint.

 *
 * Falling straight from a paid model to the free router sounds fine until the
 * free router is out of requests for the day, which is its normal state: it is
 * capped at 1,000 for the whole account. Then a provider-side 429 on the
 * preferred model - which is a hiccup lasting seconds, not an outage - drops a
 * character onto something that cannot answer at all, and it stands still.
 * That is exactly what happened to Hollis, Cutter and Ash.
 *
 * So there is a second paid model in between, from a different provider, picked
 * from the same fourteen-run test as the first: 14/14 clean intents, 291ms,
 * which was the fastest of everything measured. It costs about three and a half
 * times the preferred one and is still a quarter of what this world used to run
 * on, and it is only reached when the first is refusing.
