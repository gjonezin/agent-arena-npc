/**
 * What a character is built to remember.
 *
 * Both of the things checked here fail silently if they regress, which is why
 * they are worth a test rather than a comment. A history window that is too
 * small does not error, it just quietly gives a character amnesia. And an
 * observational-memory model left at its default points at Google, which this
 * deployment has no key for, so compaction would look configured and do
 * nothing until the day somebody went looking for last week.
