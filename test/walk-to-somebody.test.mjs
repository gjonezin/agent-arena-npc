/**
 * Reaching somebody standing nearby, outside a character's own town.
 *
 * placesIn() only ever has entries for home turf (see world.ts's own module
 * doc) - deliberately, so a character does not arrive omniscient about a room
 * it has never stood in. But that means everywhere else, "walk" had nothing
 * at all to send a character to except an unvisited patch of ground: eleven
 * NPCs went live across the arena regions and none of them could be walked
 * to by name, so `talk_to` kept failing as too far away with nowhere for a
 * character to go to close the distance. This is the other half of that fix:
 * walk() now tries a person before it gives up and wanders off exploring.
