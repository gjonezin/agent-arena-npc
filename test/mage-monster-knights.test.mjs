 * Nerys the mage, Ash the sentient monster, and the two wandering knights.

 * the sheets are wired the way this batch was supposed to be wired. Nerys and
 * Ash get the full capability set, not a cut-down one; the knights run on
 * Routine rather than Autonomous and never call the model to decide where to
 * walk; and every patrol stop is a real place from world.ts, not one made up
 * for this file.
