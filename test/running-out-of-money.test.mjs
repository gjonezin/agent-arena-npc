/**
 * This world has gone quiet before because an account emptied.
 *
 * It is the worst way for it to fail. Not one character behaving oddly, which
 * anybody would notice: a town where nobody moves and nothing looks broken,
 * with the provider's refusal the only sign, buried in eleven containers' logs.
 *
 * So no character names one model any more. It names the one it would rather
 * think with and the free router sits underneath, and Mastra walks the list.
 * A character whose account has run dry keeps talking, more cheaply and
 * probably less well, which beats standing still by a distance.
