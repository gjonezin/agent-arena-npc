 * Guy was heard talking about "bots". Nothing had leaked into his memory:
 * reldens-bots is a real room, and the fallback that turns a scene key into a
 * name strips the prefix and the dashes and hands back "bots", so the world
 * told him there was a place called that and he repeated it. The same fallback
 * had "gravity", "arena crypt", and one room that came out as "bots forest
 * house 01 n0", which no person has ever said out loud.
 *
 * These pin the whole set, because the failure is not in any one name. It is
 * that a room without a name gets one made out of its database key, silently,
 * and the first anybody hears of it is a character saying it in public.
