/**
 * Naming a door the way a person would, not the way the map spells it.
 *
 * A door only ever has a label built from where it leads (see doorLabel() /
 * plainSceneName()), so a character that calls it "the inn door" or "the
 * tavern door" is describing it, not quoting it. Matching has to meet that
 * halfway - strip the words that carry nothing ("the", "door"), fall back to
 * whatever the name and the label actually share - and when it still cannot
 * settle on one, it has to say which candidates it is choosing between or
 * what is actually there, never just that it "could not tell".
