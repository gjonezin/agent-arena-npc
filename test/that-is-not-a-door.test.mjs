/**
 * Guy asked for "the east gate" thirteen times from inside a house.
 *
 * Each time he was told there is no door here called that, which is true, and
 * useless. The east gate is a spot in town, through a door he could see the
 * whole time. He had been told plainly it had failed three, four, five times,
 * and told he was going in circles, and none of it helped, because none of it
 * told him the one thing he needed: that the name he was using is a place, not
 * a door, and how to get to it.
 *
 * A character that knows where somewhere is and cannot reach it is worse off
 * than one that has never heard of the place.
