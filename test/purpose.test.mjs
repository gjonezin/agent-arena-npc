/**
 * Keeping hold of what you were doing.
 *
 * A goal stated once at startup is gone by the second conversation, because
 * after that the only things in front of the model are a room and a line of
 * dialogue, and it will answer the dialogue. So the brief - what it wants,
 * where it has got to, what it owes, what it is holding in mind - is built into
 * every situation, and every prompt is built from a situation. That is the
 * thing worth pinning: not that the brief reads well, but that there is no
 * prompt a character can be asked which does not carry it.
