/**
 * Finding things out, and hearing about them from somebody else.

 * The world is only worth talking about if nobody starts out knowing it. So a
 * character records where it has been, records separately what it was merely
 * told, and keeps the two apart - because the gap between them is the reason to
 * walk across town and look. Going somewhere yourself settles the question;
 * somebody repeating a rumour does not.
